## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data creation}

url_in <- "https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/"

file_names <- c("time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv",
                "time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv",
                "time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv",
                "time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv")
urls <- str_c(url_in,file_names)

```


```{r data download}

global_cases <- read_csv(urls[1])
global_deaths <- read_csv(urls[2])
us_cases <- read_csv(urls[3])
us_deaths <- read_csv(urls[4])

```
```{r pivots}
global_cases <-global_cases %>% pivot_longer(cols = -c ('Province/State', 'Country/Region',Lat, Long), names_to = "date",values_to = "cases") %>% select(-c(Lat,Long))


```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
